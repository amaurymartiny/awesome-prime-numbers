### Popularizer Books

- ðŸ“– [The Music of the Primes](https://plus.maths.org/content/music-primes): By Marcus du Sautoy. Provides a good history of prime numbers, but does get more technical than your average public maths book.

## Primality Tests

A primality test is an algorithm for determining whether an input number is prime.

- [Primality proving - an introduction](https://primes.utm.edu/prove/prove1.html)
- Quick tests:

  - [Rabin-Miller Strong Pseudoprime Test](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Rabin-MillerStrongPseudoprimeTest.html)
- Classical tests:
  - [Pepin's Test](https://primes.utm.edu/prove/prove3_1.html): For Fermat numbers.
  - [Lucas-Lehmer Test](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Lucas-LehmerTest.html)
- General purpose tests:
  - [APR and APR-CL](https://primes.utm.edu/prove/prove4_1.html)
  - [Elliptic Curve Primality Proving](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EllipticCurvePrimalityProving.html): The fastest known general-purpose primality testing algorithm.
